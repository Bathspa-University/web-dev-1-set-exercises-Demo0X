        <p>
          Planet Mars has been invaded by an unknown species, that sends
          irregular signals to Earth as if it wants Humanity to discover it.
          Three brave astronauts were dispatched tasked with investigating the
          alien lifeform that took a shape of a spherical structure. That
          lifeform was later discovered and now known as, The Traveler. The
          Traveler is of unknown origins, but all we know is that because of its
          appearance humans progressed at speeds that were once unthinkable,
          This began a new era called as "The Golden Era". However, The Traveler
          was not alone for it had brought alongside it new foes that threaten
          the safety of Humanity and Planet Earth as they know it. It is now our
          job as Guardians to use the powers of The Traveler and defeat our
          enemies.
